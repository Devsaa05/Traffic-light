# Traffic-light
2-way traffic light using TM4C123
   In this project, a smart traffic control system (STCS) for the infrastructure in the smart city is proposed, which can be widely applied for the intelligent transportation system in smart city applications after some changes in it. The major components in the proposed STCS include TIVA-C Board, then the data can be sent online through WIFI or Bluetooth to make it IOT project too. It supports various smart city ITS applications including eco-driving, pre-time signal control, 
The TM4C123 is the core of this work, where we discuss little bit about the system architecture, middleware, peripheral hardware modules, and control algorithm.
We can take this on higher level too just by adding IOT module, more sensors, etc.
In the future, real-time traffic information fusion for Adaptive Traffic Signal Control (ATSC) by integrating multiple data sources such as loop detector and smart AVI is to be designed.
